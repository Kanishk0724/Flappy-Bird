**I've updated the bird to have a much more bird-like appearance with these changes:**

**1. Created a composite bird with several elements:**
-A yellow oval body with rounded edges (using border-radius)
-An orange wing that animates up and down
-An orange beak
-A black eye

**2. Added rotation animations:**
-The bird tilts upward when you jump
-The bird tilts downward when falling
-The bird rotates 90 degrees when the game is over

**3. Made the wing flap with a CSS animation that runs continuously**

**4. To play:**
-Click the "Start Game" button or anywhere on the game screen
-Tap/click or press spacebar to make the bird flap and gain height
-Navigate through the pipe gaps
-Try to achieve the highest score possible!
